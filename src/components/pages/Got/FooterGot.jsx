            fire. When they go to their knees, however, you must help them back
            to their feet. Elsewise no man will ever bend the knee to you. And
            any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king at all. Aerys
            never understood that, but you will. When I've won your war for you,
            we will restore the king's peace and the king's justice."
