      "In Middle-earth, the Dark Lord Sauron created the Great Rings of Power, forged by Elven smiths. Three for Elf-kings, seven for Dwarf Lords, and nine for Mortal Men. Secretly, Sauron also forged a master ring, the One Ring, which contains within it the power to enslave all of Middle-earth. With the help of a group of friends and brave allies, Frodo sets out on a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring. But the Dark Lord Sauron, who created the Ring, sends his servants to chase the group. If Sauron succeeded in retrieving the Ring, it would be the end of Middle-earth.",

The time has come for the fate of Middle-earth to be decided, and for the first time in a long time, there seems to be a little hope. The attention of the dark lord Sauron is now focused on Gondor, the last stronghold of men, and of which Aragorn will have to claim the throne to occupy the position of king of him. But Sauron's forces are already preparing to launch the last and final attack against the kingdom of Gondor, the battle that will decide the fate of all. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue on their way to Mordor, hoping that Sauron will not notice that two little Hobbits are getting closer every day to the end of their path, Mount Doom.",

Obsessed above all with the reclaimed kingdom, Thorin sacrifices friendship and honor to keep him as Bilbo frantically tries to make him see why the hobbit is making a desperate and dangerous choice. But there are even greater dangers ahead. With no apparent help from the wizard Gandalf, his great enemy Sauron has sent legions of orcs towards the Lonely Mountain in a sneak attack. As darkness closes in on them, the races of Dwarves, Elves and Men must decide whether to unite or be destroyed. Bilbo will thus find himself in the epic battle of the Five Armies, where the future of Middle-earth hangs in the balance.",
